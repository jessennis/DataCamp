Another way of handling missing values is to replace them all with the same value. For numerical variables, one option is to replace values with 0â€” you'll do this here. However, when you replace missing values, you make assumptions about what a missing value means. In this case, you will assume that a missing number sold means that no sales for that avocado type were made that week.

In this exercise, you'll see how replacing missing values can affect the distribution of a variable using histograms. You can plot histograms for multiple variables at a time as follows:

dogs[["height_cm", "weight_kg"]].hist()
pandas has been imported as pd and matplotlib.pyplot has been imported as plt. The avocados_2016 dataset is available.

A list has been created, cols_with_missing, containing the names of columns with missing values: "small_sold", "large_sold", and "xl_sold".
Create a histogram of those columns.
Show the plot.

# List the columns with missing values
cols_with_missing = ["small_sold", "large_sold", "xl_sold"]

# Create histograms showing the distributions cols_with_missing
avocados_2016[cols_with_missing].hist()
# Show the plot
plt.show()
